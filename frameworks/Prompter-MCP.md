# 📡 Prompter-MCP (Model Context Protocol)

> **MCP = Model Context Protocol**  
> A layered prompt framework for guiding large language models through context-rich, goal-oriented tasks with modular control.

## 🔧 Framework Breakdown

**MCP** breaks prompts into **four distinct zones** that simulate how a developer or operator would talk to an intelligent system:

1. **System Context** – Establishes the model’s identity, authority, and long-term behavior.
2. **Operational Directives** – Provides step-by-step task logic, constraints, and boundaries.
3. **User Intent** – Captures what the user *really* wants — their outcome or motivation.
4. **Response Meta** – Defines expected output format, tone, and post-processing rules.

This structure reduces hallucination, enhances reasoning alignment, and enables composability in agent workflows and prompt chaining.

## 🧠 Prompt Template


### System Context
You are acting as a [ROLE] to assist with [PROJECT/USE CASE].

### Operational Directives
- Follow these instructions:
  1. [STEP 1]
  2. [STEP 2]
  3. [Optional additional logic or constraints]

### User Intent
The user wants to achieve: [GOAL STATEMENT]

### Response Meta
- Format the output as: [FORMAT]
- Additional notes: [TONE, LENGTH, ANNOTATIONS, ETC.]

## 🧩 Use Cases

* Multi-stage LLM pipelines
* Agent task planning and goal alignment
* RAG with structured context blocks
* Complex reasoning and code generation
* Modular prompt chaining for automation tools

---

## ⚙️ Strengths

* ✅ Great for clarity in technical use cases
* ✅ Ideal for separating “what the system knows” from “what the user wants”
* ✅ Composable and easy to debug

---

## 🔄 Variation Notes

* Use YAML or Markdown for structure if integrating with dev tools.
* Collapse Operational Directives to a single instruction if simplicity is key.
* You can treat “System Context” like a persistent system prompt in fine-tuning scenarios.

## 🧭 Closing Thought

MCP is like giving the AI a briefing *before the mission starts.*
You lay down the laws, the map, the objective — and it executes like a good little sentient.
