# Prompter-PHP

## Description

Prompter-PHP (Prompt Hooks Protocol) is a composable prompting format that splits prompts into named sections or ‚Äúhooks‚Äù like ROLE, CONTEXT, INSTRUCTION, STYLE, and GOAL. Each hook can be reused, injected, or versioned independently.

## Why Use It

This system is perfect for anyone building LLM pipelines, prompt chains, or agent frameworks. It gives you clean separation of concerns, makes prompts easier to debug, and allows partial updates without rewriting everything. Think of it as the MVC pattern, but for prompt engineering.

## Examples
