# Prompter-Lazy

## Description

Prompter-Lazy is an ultra-minimal prompting technique. Instead of defining role, structure, or goal, you feed the LLM the barebones input â€” and let it do the heavy lifting. This is ideal for letting the model exercise creativity or intuition.

## Why Use It

Detailed prompts = more control. But sometimes, control kills magic. Lazy prompting is perfect when:
- You donâ€™t want to over-engineer
- You want unexpected, serendipitous output
- Youâ€™re building creativity-first apps
- Youâ€™re iterating fast without caring about exact format

## Examples

### ðŸ§  Example 1 â€” Story Starter

Prompt: A crow wakes up in a lab and discovers it can speak.

---

### ðŸ§  Example 2 â€” Product Naming

Prompt: Suggest 10 edgy, one-word names for a startup that lets people rent luxury pets for Instagram photos.

## Tip

Donâ€™t be afraid to say less. The better the LLM, the more it can infer. Youâ€™re not giving it less â€” youâ€™re giving it *space*.
