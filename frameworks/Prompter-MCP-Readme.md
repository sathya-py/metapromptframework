## Overview

**Prompter-MCP** (Model Context Protocol) is a layered prompt design method that helps separate the **system‚Äôs operating rules**, **task logic**, **user intent**, and **response expectations**. It‚Äôs especially useful when building agents, complex automations, or RAG systems where context clarity is critical.

## üß± Prompt Structure

| Section               | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System Context        | Defines the AI‚Äôs role and use case or domain                            |
| Operational Directives| Provides step-by-step instructions, rules, and logic                    |
| User Intent           | Captures the user's goal in natural language                            |
| Response Meta         | Specifies how the response should be structured and delivered           |
