# Prompter-Lazy

Prompter-Lazy is a minimalist prompting pattern that relies on the LLM’s internal capabilities to infer task structure, style, and intention. Instead of spelling out roles, formats, or detailed goals, you give it just enough to work with — and let the model decide how best to respond.

This works great when:
- You want high variability and creativity
- You trust the model to “figure it out”
- You’re prototyping ideas quickly
- You’re working with advanced models that infer context well

## Key Philosophy

- Less is more.
- Don’t explain what the model already knows.
- Prompt like you would nudge a human expert — vaguely, but intentionally.

## Template

Prompt: [Minimal instruction or question]

*(No additional structure, no role declaration, no format constraints)*

## Use Cases

- Creative writing (stories, lyrics, jokes)
- Brainstorming or ideation
- Intuition-based decision making
- One-shot tasks where context is obvious
- Letting the model surprise you

## Example

Prompt: Write a dialogue between a paranoid AI and a bored teenager in an elevator.
