# Prompter-Reflect

## Description

Prompter-Reflect is a prompt pattern that forces the LLM to reflect on its own output before finalizing it. By prompting the model to self-review and revise, it produces more accurate, insightful, or creative results.

## Why Use It

LLMs tend to accept their first draft as final. Reflection prompts break that habit. They improve:
- Logical coherence
- Factual correctness
- Depth and nuance
- Overall polish of the response

This pattern mirrors how great thinkers operate â€” answer, analyze, refine.

## Examples

### ðŸ§  Example 1 â€” Concept Explanation

**Prompt:**  
Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning in simple terms.

**Reflect:**  
Now analyze your answer. Did you use too much jargon? Could it be made simpler?

**Revise:**  
Rewrite your explanation using your reflection.

### ðŸ§  Example 2 â€” Business Pitch Refinement

**Prompt:**  
Write a 2-line pitch for an app that finds hidden hiking trails.

**Reflect:**  
Evaluate the pitch. Is it catchy? Does it explain the value clearly?

**Revise:**  
Improve the pitch based on your self-critique.

## Tip

You can tweak the reflection angle depending on the task: factuality for science, tone for marketing, logic for coding, etc. It's like turning on the model's second brain.
