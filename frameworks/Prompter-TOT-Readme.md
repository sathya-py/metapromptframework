# Prompter-ToT

## Description

Prompter-ToT (Tree of Thought) uses branching logic to let LLMs simulate deeper reasoning. Itâ€™s designed to help with complex problems by encouraging exploration of **multiple parallel thought paths** before settling on an answer.

## Why Use It

ToT avoids early commitment to the first idea. It forces breadth before depth, leading to higher-quality outcomes. Ideal for strategic decisions, creative generation, or comparing trade-offs in technical planning.

## Examples

### ðŸ§  Example 1 â€” Strategic Product Feature Design

Problem: Add a new viral feature to a journaling app.

Step 1:  
- A: AI mood analysis  
- B: Anonymous quote sharing  
- C: Time capsule feature

Step 2:  
- A: Uses sentiment to tag entries, cool but privacy-sensitive  
- B: Lets users share quotes; viral but risk of trolling  
- C: Users write messages to future selves; nostalgic

Step 3:  
- B may be viral but risky  
- C fits emotionally and is unique  
- A is valuable but low virality

Step 4: Choose C â€” strong emotional hook + social potential.

### ðŸ§  Example 2 â€” Critical Thinking in Legal Argument

Problem: Should AI-generated art have copyright?

Step 1:  
- A: Yes, itâ€™s a creative output  
- B: No, lacks human authorship  
- C: Case-by-case basis

Step 2:  
- A: Output is novel, deserves IP protection  
- B: Lacks human intent, undermines IP law  
- C: Hybrid systems (human + AI) need new categories

Step 3:  
- A is progressive but vague legally  
- B is strict but realistic  
- C offers nuanced governance

Step 4: Pick C â€” most balanced and future-proof.

## Tip

Donâ€™t rush the answer. Let the model **stay inside the branches**. ToT works best when you set clear expectations to *pause and explore each idea fully* before resolving.
