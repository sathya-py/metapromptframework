# MetaPromptFramework

**MetaPromptFramework** is a collection of advanced meta-prompt engineering templates and design patterns built for LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and beyond. This framework provides a structured, reusable, and scalable way to craft high-performance prompts across automation, agents, RAG pipelines, and AI-first applications.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- 📐 Structured frameworks like CRAFT, MCP, MODP, ReAct, and more
- 🧩 Modular templates for reuse and chaining
- 🧠 Model-agnostic design — works across OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral
- ⚙️ Built to support LLMOps, AgentOps, and real-world AI apps

## 🧱 Current Frameworks

- Prompter-CRAFT
- Prompter-MCP
- Prompter-MODP  
*(+10 more coming soon)*

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Autonomous agents  
- RAG-enabled projects  
- Custom copilots & AI assistants  
- AI workflow automation  
- Structured context design
